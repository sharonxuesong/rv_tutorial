Synthetic solar and M dwarf spectra.

These files are originally from Sharon Xuesong Wang’s EarthFinder projects.

Both contain two variables. arr_0 is the wavelength in nm in vacuum, arr_1 is the normalized flux.

HD95735-BTSettl.npz	
- A normalized M dwarf spectrum generated by Mark Veyette using Boston U.’s version of BTSettl, using stellar parameters of HD 95735. It is normalized empirically, NOT from the BTSettl original continuum.

Kurucz_Sun.npz
- Kurucz solar model from ATLAS9.
