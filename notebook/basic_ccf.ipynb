Our next task would be to try to get the RV of this observed spectrum with CCF using the \"stellar template\", which is the original spectrum before the shift (note: this stellar template has a wider wavelength span than your order of shifted spectrum, so we don't have to worry about edge effects). \n",

    "Note: Some people use a mask instead of a stellar template (Baranne et al. 1996) then fit a Gaussian to the CCF - it's mathematically equivalent with using a spectrum (with a Gaussian line profile) to perform the CCF and obtain the minima/maxima of the CCF (credit: David Hogg).\n",

This is because **$z$ is what you are actually measuring, not the relative RV** between your stellar template and your observed template. To translate $z$ into RV, you need to perform the barycentric correction, which involves relativistic terms so a simple $z = RV/c$ does not work."

However, this is wrong in our context. The formal CCF is really $\\sum{(s-f)^2}$, and when you have a constant $\\sum{s^2}$ and $\\sum{f^2}$, you can just use the cross term. However, this is not true in our case! When we are shifting the stellar template spectrum around within the wavelength window of the observed spectrum, on the edge, some portion will be shifted in and out. So your template spectrum $s$ actually changes every time you use a different $z$, so $\\sum{s^2}$ is not constant! "
